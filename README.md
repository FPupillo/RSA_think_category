This repository contains data from the fMRI analysis of a task in 
which participants have to think at several categories. We applied RSA to different 
ROIs to check whether it is possible to similarities in patterns of activation in within-categoriy trials compared to between ones. 

### Analysis_steps.docs

## by_sub_rdm
this file contains the dissimilarity matrices by subject and ROI

### labels.csv
